# Project Overview :
- This project is a content-based recommendation system for Netflix titles. It recommends similar movies or TV shows based on the genres of a given title. The system uses:
- TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text (genres) into numerical data.
- Cosine Similarity to compute the similarity between titles.
- Streamlit for the user interface, which is designed to look like Netflix's theme.
